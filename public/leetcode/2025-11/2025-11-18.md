Hello, I'm back...
This isn't the daily question but from the [Neetcode 150 Roadmap](https://neetcode.io/practice). I'm going to start doing these everyday for practice and to help peeps starting out.

The first few days are going to probably be easy but I'll do it in C++ (new language yippee).

This one's a pretty straightforward question, have a seen set containing all the elements seen so far and then just check each element against the seen set and return true if we find a duplicate and false otherwise.

Unfortunately, I have no idea how to implement sets in `cpp` so this was a learning experience:
- `set<type>` is the type of set (need to `#include <set>`)
- `.insert(value)` adds the value
- `.erase(value)` to remove the value
- `.clear()` to remove everything
- `.size()` to get the size
- `.contains(value)` to check if the value is in the set

```cpp
class Solution {
public:
    bool containsDuplicate(vector<int>& nums) {
        set<int> seen {};
        for (int num: nums) {
            if (seen.contains(num)) {
                return true;
            }
            seen.insert(num);
        }

        return false;
    }
};
```
