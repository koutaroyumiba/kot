    <h1><span class="span-header">~/about/me</span> $ <span class="span-command">cat desc</span></h1>
    <p>
        kot is a caffeine-charged twenty-something who swears he knows every decent coffee spot in Auckland (and he's probably right). if he's not sipping on a cold brew, he's probably buried somewhere in his terminal window, whispering "neovim btw" like it's both a flex and lifestyle choice.
    </p>
    <p>
        his room has been quietly overrun by smiskis (cutest beings on the planet), and his headphones are 24/7 pumping out ONE OK ROCK, the greatest band on earth (no debate necessary).
    </p>
    <p>
        in his spare time, you’ll find him hovering over a coffee brew like it’s a science experiment (a proper setup is coming soon, promise), scribbling thoughts into pen and paper like it’s still 1923, or hammering away at his alien-looking keyboard. when he’s not doing that, he’s usually diving headfirst into some niche rabbit hole or sketching out the beginnings of his next big community project.
    </p>

            this website is inspired by my friend's website (<a href="https://ericzheng.nz" target="_blank">ericzheng.nz</a>) and the writing style is 'inspired' also by my friend (<a href="https://alanna.nz" target="blank">alanna.nz</a> - questionable). the main reason why this page was created was kind of to have a place to put my projects and (more importantly) my <a href="/leetcode">leetcode</a> progress. it's also a nice place to test new things (the website is using astro which I used for the first time) and expand my web development skillset. hopefully, you find this website cool and check out some of the projects that i've been cooking up in <a href="/projects">./projects</a>!
