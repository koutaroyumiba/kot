    <h1><span class="span-header">~/projects/neovim</span> $ </h1>
    <p>I love neovim...</p>
    <p>Did I say I love neovim...?</p>

    <h2><span class="span-header">~/projects/neovim</span> $ cat description</h2>
    <p>
        tech stack is mostly in lua.
    </p>
    <h2><span class="span-header">~/projects/neovim</span> $ cat challenges</h2>
    <p>
        lsp's are definitely the challenge when it comes to code editors
    </p>
    <h2><span class="span-header">~/projects/neovim</span> $ cat learnings</h2>
    <p>
        definitely vim keybindings and lua.
        it also teaches you a lot about LSP.
        also it forces you to think about things that you would never consider if you were always using VSCode
    </p>
    <p>
        - such as file navigation, diagnostics, buffers, windows, file searches, etc - forced to optimize these
    </p>
    <h2><span class="span-header">~/projects/neovim</span> $ cat value</h2>
    <p>
        clearly made me a better programmer as a result and definitely made me faster at coding
